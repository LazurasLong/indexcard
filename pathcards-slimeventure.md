# Soggy Room (Front)

Dark damp square cement shelter. A pipe protrudes
perpendicular to wall. Wall-pipe-droplets drip down,
sheening the floor with cold mildew water. A large
pipe rim shyly pokes above the water sheen, modestly
presenting a locked grating. A door slumps from its
frame, bleeding light arounds its edges.

The sheen quivers, bunches toward the center,
and jellifies. The slime is forcing a
`BATTLE`!

The slime waters down to the floor, returning
to its former state. Options:

  * `TALK` to the slime
  * Go through the door
    (`NEXT CARD`)
  * To `OPEN` the locked pipe and reveal its
    treasures, either pick the lock (`HAS EVADE 10`),
    or `USE` a key

# Soggy Room (Back)

Slime `BATTLE`:

  * `HEART`: 20
  * `BAM`: 1
  * `EVADE`: 7
  * `CRIT`: 4
  * Drops: CANDY

Slime `TALK`:

  * `HAS HEART 10`: The slime responds to your
    empathy with an apologetic jelly hug.
  * Ripples spread across the water.
