# Battle Ruleset

Start with: 20 `HEALTH`, 1 `FORCE`, 1 `ACTION`, and 4 points
to distribute; each point adds 5 to `HEALTH`. Choose 1 ability
and 1 trait.

Player with highest `ACTION` is first, go clockwise. Call move
and target first. Rest regains 1 `ACTION`. Hit deals `FORCE`
damage. Any move fails if roll 1. Abilities use 1 `ACTION`:

  * *Heal*: recover `FORCE` + roll `HEALTH`
  * *Rolling Hit*: deal `FORCE` + roll damage
  * *Poof*: nullify damage if roll 5 or 6

Traits:

  * *Durable*: Take only 1 damage when resting
  * *Critical*: If roll 6 or 5 when hitting, add that roll to damage
  * *Failsafe*: Moves never fail
