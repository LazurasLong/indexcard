# Battle Ruleset

Start with: 20 `HEALTH`, 1 `FORCE`, 1 `ACTION`, and 4 points
to distribute; each point adds 10 to `HEALTH`. Choose 1 ability
and 1 trait.

Player with highest `ACTION` is first, go clockwise. Call move
and target first. Rest regains 1 `ACTION`. Hit deals `FORCE`
damage. Any move fails if roll 1. Abilities use 1 `ACTION`:

  * *Heal*: recover `FORCE` + roll `HEALTH`
  * *Rolling Hit*: deal `FORCE` + roll damage
  * *Poof*: nullify damage if roll 5 or 6

Traits:

  * *Durable*: Take only 1 damage when resting
  * *Critical*: If roll 6 or 5 when hitting, add that roll to damage
  * *Failsafe*: Moves never fail

# Choose Your Own Adventure Ruleset

Choose-your-own-adventure book. Each page generally consists of
a description, then options/outcomes which lead to different pages.

An option could be as simple as "Open the door, go to page 5," or
more complex like "Try to pick the lock on door, roll 4 or higher
to go to page 8, else go to page 9."

To initiate a battle, simply list enemy name and stats beneath
the description. Have outcome options for battle pages, e.g.,
"If you win, turn to page 33, if you lost turn to page 21."

Be sure to have lots of options with skill checks, too! For
example, "To open the rusty door, and your `FORCE` is at least
4, turn to page 10."

Be sure to think about parties of adventurers, not just solo.
