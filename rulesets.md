# Battle Ruleset

Start with: 20 `HEALTH`, 1 `FORCE`, 2 `ACTION`, and 4 points
to distribute; point adds 5 to `HEARTS`. Choose 2 abilities.

Turns ordered by `ACTION`. Parry regains `ACTION`, take two less
damage per hit this round. Flee if you can roll a 5 or 6. Ability
uses 1 `ACTION`. Hit deals `FORCE` damage, +3 on roll 6, miss on 1.
Ability effects stay in play until/unless target rolls 1 or 6:

  * Curse: miss
  * Poison: lose 1 `HEALTH`
  * Heal: recover 1 `HEALTH`
  * Buff: +1 `FORCE`
