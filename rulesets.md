# Battle Ruleset

Start with: 20 `HEALTH`, 2 `FORCE`, 2 `ACTION`, and 4 points
to distribute; point adds 5 to `HEALTH`. Choose 1 ability and 1
trait.

Turns ordered by `ACTION`. Parry regains 1 `ACTION`, take two less
damage per hit this round. Flee if you can roll a 5 or 6. Ability
uses 1 `ACTION`. Hit deals `FORCE` damage, +2 on 6, miss on 1.
Abilities affect target until/unless they roll 1 or 6:

  * Poison: lose 1 `HEALTH`
  * Heal: recover 1 `HEALTH`
  * Buff: +2 `FORCE`

Traits:

  * *Resourceful*: Restore 1 `ACTION` when you roll a 1 or 6
  * *Durable*: Take only 1 damage when parrying. +15 to `HEALTH`.
  * *Caustic*: If roll 6 or 5 when hitting, add 2 to damage
