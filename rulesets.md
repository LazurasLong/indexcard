# Battle Ruleset

Start with: 20 `HEALTH`, 1 `FORCE`, 2 `ACTION`, and 4 points
to distribute; point adds 5 to `HEARTS`. Choose 2 abilities.

Turns ordered by `ACTION`. Parry regains 1 `ACTION`, take two less
damage per hit this round. Flee if you can roll a 5 or 6. Ability
uses 1 `ACTION`. Hit deals `FORCE` damage, +3 on roll 6, miss on 1.
Ability effects target until/unless they roll 1 or 6:

  * Daze: miss
  * Poison: lose 1 `HEALTH`
  * Heal: recover 1 `HEALTH`
  * Buff: +2 `FORCE`

# Traits

These are kinda like classes! Choose one when creating a character!

*Resourceful*: Every time you roll a 1 you restore 1 `ACTION`.

*Simple*: Ability effects which target you are negated,
but you also cannot use abilities.

*Durable*: You only take one damage when parrying.

*Caustic*: +2 to `FORCE`.
