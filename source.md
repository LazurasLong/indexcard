# Supplement Ruleset: Path Cards

`REQUIRES: Usable Items`

A novel is a series of cards which have a scenario and options. Write the story, where each option may have `REQUIREMENTS` and `EVENTS`.

Option `REQUIREMENTS`:

  * `USE x`: Item `x` is required for this option.
  * `CHECK stat x FAIL y`: Option requires `stat` + `roll` to at least be `x`, else `FAIL` event `y`. Example: use for conversation, `"You're looking pretty!" CHECK HEARTS 20 FAIL BATTLE`

Option `EVENTS`:

  * `OPEN`: Get item #ROLL from the chest on the back of this path card
  * `BATTLE`: Battle monster on the back of this path card
  * `NEXTCARD`: select random path card from this novel

Preface non-required things which require a supplement with `SUPPLEMENT supplement card name`.

Use die roll to determine who the monster attacks.
