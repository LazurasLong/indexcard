# Soggy Room (Front)

A dark, damp stone room, cluttered with stone debris. A sheen
of murky water gently ripples, the flush rim of a large pipe
presents a locked grating, behind it hay nests something
bundled in a dingy white cloth. A door slumps from its frame,
bleeding light around its edges.

The water quivers, and jellifies as it gathers at the center,
poorly depicting a woman. She sticks out her lop-sided, drooping
tongue and throws some of herself--it burns (`BATTLE`)!

She spells out "Sorry!" with herself before watering down,
resheening the floor. Options:

  * `TALK` to the water
  * Go through the door
    (`NEXT CARD`)
  * To `OPEN` the locked pipe either pick the lock
    (`EVADE 10`) or `USE` a key.

  * The water ripples affectionately
