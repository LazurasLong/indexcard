# Soggy Room (Front)

Dark damp square cement shelter. A pipe protrudes
perpendicular to wall. Wall-pipe-droplets drip down,
sheening the floor with cold mildew water. A large
pipe rim shyly pokes above the water sheen, modestly
presenting a locked grating. A door slumps from its
frame, bleeding light arounds its edges.

The sheen quivers, bunches toward the center,
and jellifies. The slime is forcing a
`BATTLE`!

The slime waters down to the floor, returning
to its former state. Options:

  * `TALK` to the slime
  * Go through the door
    (`NEXT CARD`)
  * To `OPEN` the locked pipe and reveal its
    treasures, either pick the lock (`HAS EVADE 10`),
    or `USE` a key
